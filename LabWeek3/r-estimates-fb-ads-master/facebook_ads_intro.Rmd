# Facebook

Facebook is the social network par excellence. [As of 2016](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/), **79%** of US internet users are on Facebook.

# In the news...

Facebook Ads are a locus of concern about discrimination, about "fake news", and so on.

# In research

Using Facebook Ads is cutting edge: 

- Emilio's paper with Ingmar Weber and Krishna Gummadi using it to study stocks of international migrants just came out this month. 
([paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12102/full), [news](http://www.washington.edu/news/2017/10/12/using-facebook-data-as-a-real-time-census/))
- J. Nathan Matias and others did an audit this summer of who had access to the 'Pride' reaction.

# The Ads Manager

The ability to target ads by demographics and interests is at the core of both the potential of and the concerns about Facebook Ads.

# Example: description

Even when large proportions of users don't provide a piece of information, you can still see clear geographic patterns.

# Example: validation

The, it is possible to compare those patterns to existing data sources, which have their own sets of biases and limitations.

# Technical overview

**Authentication:**

Two components: an *access token* and an *ads account*. 

**Requesting information:**

You specify the audience you want to reach using a *targeting spec* in a JSON format; you then get an estimate of how many users that specification will reach.

# Pythonistas, you're in luck

Matheus Araujo has written `pySocialWatcher`, a Python module for collecting social data from the Marketing API: https://github.com/maraujo/pySocialWatcher

It relies on the `requests` package, Python's version of `httr`.

Facebook also provides a Python SDK for the Marketing API, which is an interface/abstraction to the API: https://github.com/facebook/facebook-python-ads-sdk

# Using other Facebook APIs from R

`SocialMediaLab` and `Rfacebook` are packages that provide access to public Facebook pages and other aspects of Facebook's Graph API.

To use these, you can generate a standard OAuth access token from your app ID and app secret, much like you would do with Twitter.
